=head1 NAME

OurCal - a simple yet featureful personal calendaring system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a example index.cgi

    my $config    = OurCal::Config->new( file => 'ourcal.conf' );
    my $handler   = OurCal::Handler->new( config => $config);
    my $cal       = OurCal->new( date => $handler->date, user => $handler->user, config => $config );
    my $view      = OurCal::View->load_view($handler->view, config => $config->config, calendar => $cal);

    print $handler->header($view->mime_type);
    print $view->handle($handler->mode);

=head2 DESCRIPTION

OurCal was written one hungover Sunday afternoon 5 years ago and hasn't 
changed that much since. It's not a complicated calendaring system, I've 
got other code to do that, but it's simple and extendable and it works.

Feature wise:

=over 4

=item simple events

OurCal has no concept of start or end times - an event is on a day or it 
isn't. Surprisingly this suffices 99% of my time and makes things much 
quicker and easier internally.

Events can be marked up using the Chump syntax which is kind of like 
Markdown but had the virtue of existing at the time. There's no real 
reason why Chump couldn't be ripped out and replaced with Markdown.

Events have a date and a description and that's pretty much it. If you 
want more feed me beer and choclate covered coffee beans until I get 
round to finishing EventQueue.

=item todos

OurCal has simple TODO items as well - these are also marked up in 
Chump.

=item icalendar

OurCal can import iCalendar feeds from both local and remote sources and 
can also export an ICS feed. Since it's all done with plugins (I loves 
me my plugins) you could write plugins to import and export whatever you 
want. 

=item multi user

Nominally OurCal is multi user but there's no user management to speak 
of and I only ever use it for one person so I wouldn't know. 

=item hCalendar

All events use hCalendar semantic markup because I'm nothing if not 
Buzzword Compatible.

=item mod_perl

There's no mod_perl or mod_perl handler at the moment but it'd be but a 
moments work to do.

=head2 new <params>

Requires a C<config> param of type C<OurCal::Config> and a C<date> param

param. No user validation is done.
